## Concept

[Jpegtran](https://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/) can merge jpeg files into a big jpeg file. This will help reduce downloading many number of jpeg files through http.

Jpegtran drop-patch does not re-encode jpegs so thumbnails can be added later on without dropping quality.`

Thumbolidator creates two tiles of the thumbnails, Micro and Thumbo. The `Thumbo` react component will shows a micro thumbnail while loading thumbnails.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g thumbolidator
```

## Usage

```bash
$ thumbolidator ./public/images/2019-11-23/
```
